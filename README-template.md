### What I learned

Theire is many way to solve this challenge.
- with router an a global store ( redux , context ...) 

But i like to try the FormContext.

First i use Zustand.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development
